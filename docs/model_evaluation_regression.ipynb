    "These results indicate a **significant improvement** compared to previous versions of the model.\n",
    "An **R² score of 0.81** suggests that the model explains about **81% of the variance** in the target variable — a strong result for a regression task.\n",
    "The **Adjusted R² (0.796)** confirms that the model maintains high explanatory power even after accounting for the 14 input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MAE (≈5.3)** and **RMSE (≈6.8)** values are relatively low, meaning the predictions are close to the true values for most samples.\n",
    "The small difference between MAE and RMSE indicates the presence of **a few mild outliers**, but not enough to cause instability.\n",
    "The **MedAE (4.58)** reinforces that at least half of the absolute errors are below ~4.6, showing good prediction consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MAPE** is extremely high due to **zero or near-zero values in `y_true`**, which distort the percentage-based error — hence, it should **not be considered reliable** in this case.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **training loss curve** shows a **steady decline during the initial epochs**, followed by **stabilization** around an RMSE value near **6–7**, suggesting that the model **converged successfully**.\n",
    "This pattern reflects a **stable and well-tuned learning process**, with no signs of overfitting or oscillations.\n",

    "The smooth convergence also implies that the **learning rate** and **network architecture** were appropriately chosen for this regression problem.\n",

    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![Residual Plot](./images/residual_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual plot shows that most residuals are **randomly distributed around zero**, which indicates that the model is **unbiased** and does not systematically overestimate or underestimate the target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few scattered points, suggesting **potential outliers** or unusual samples, which is common in real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **no strong heteroscedasticity**, although a slight widening of residuals at higher target values can be observed, indicating the model may perform slightly worse for larger outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this residual analysis aligns with the model metrics (R² ≈ 0.81, RMSE ≈ 6.8), confirming that the model has **good predictive performance and generalization** with no major systematic bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The model demonstrates a **balanced trade-off between bias and variance**, showing good generalization performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stable convergence:** The training loss decreases smoothly and stabilizes, showing consistent learning.\n",
    "* **High R² (0.81):** The model effectively captures the relationship between features and the target variable.\n",
    "* **Moderate error levels (RMSE ≈ 6.8):** Predictions are generally accurate, with limited deviation.\n",
    "* **No strong overfitting:** The adjusted R² and training behavior suggest solid generalization capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance performance, the following adjustments could be explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase the number of epochs** slightly to refine convergence.\n",
    "2. **Apply normalization or standardization** to reduce the impact of feature scale differences.\n",
    "3. **Introduce mild regularization** (e.g., weight decay or dropout) to improve robustness to noise and outliers.\n",
    "4. **Validate performance on a separate validation set** to confirm external generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieves **strong overall performance**, explaining more than **80% of the data variance** and maintaining **consistent, moderate errors**.\n",
    "The loss curve confirms **stable convergence**, and the residual analysis reveals **no systematic bias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With minor hyperparameter adjustments and potential regularization, this regression model demonstrates **robust learning behavior and reliable predictive ability**, serving as a **solid baseline** for future improvements.\n"
